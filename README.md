# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is MichaÅ‚ DziedziÅ„ski. For over 3 years I have been working as a programmer, I constantly try to explore my knowledge and broaden my horizons through courses, participation in meetups, hackathons, workshops and conferences. I particularly want to develop in JavaScript, preferably in Vue.
